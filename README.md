Artificial Intelligence PLH311 - 1st Programming Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the first programming assignment of the course Artificial Intelligence (PLH311), focused on optimal pathfinding in a 2D environment with obstacles.

Summary
The main objective of this assignment was to implement and compare two informed search algorithms, A* and IDA*, for finding the optimal path from a given start point to a goal area in a 2D space, considering possible obstacles. The assignment explores the use of admissible heuristics, such as the Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics, and analyzes their effect on algorithm performance and solution optimality.

Key features:

A* and IDA* search algorithms implemented from scratch.
Evaluation of Euclidean and Manhattan heuristics, as well as their admissibility and consistency.
Comparison of algorithms based on number of nodes expanded and solution quality.
Analysis of how different heuristics affect search efficiency and memory usage.
The results confirm theoretical expectations: the Euclidean heuristic is generally admissible and yields optimal paths, while the Manhattan heuristic can be more efficient in the presence of obstacles. The report also highlights the importance of heuristic function selection for efficient and optimal search.
